#+title: My backed up qtile and other config files
#+author: Hp


This is my dotfiles for my whole qtile system, including dots for tools I used.

I wrote about my full experience daily driving qtile [[https://peterconfidential.com/qtile-review-tips-tricks][here]], so check it out if you'd like to read further.

** READ THIS!
This repo is meant to be used as my backup repo. I *STRONGLY* advise against blindly copy everything to your home folder. You should know what you're putting in your machine. This is meant to be a source of inspiration and reference.

My config also goes through several iterations of changes and optimization. What you see in the photos today might not be there tomorrow. It's probably available in the repo history somewhere though. Ask me if you have any questions.

** Why is everything so large?
I'm using a 7 inch umpc, hence the scaling needs to be that way. The plus side is it makes for good demonstration and screenshots. You can scale back the DPI with ~.Xresources~ file and reduce bar size in ~qtile/config.py~.

** Usage
I run the script ~backup.sh~ periodically to copy all my personal dotfiles to this repo and upload it to github.

+If you want to install everything as is what I have though, run the ~installscript.sh~ file.+ (You could, but don't do that.)

*You really should open the files you want to use first and read it through. Comment out or delete the stuff you don't want installed on your own system.*

Ideally, if I were you, I'd look into which tools I'd like to check out, and only copy the dotfiles of that tool. E.g, if I want to check out this repo's qtile config, I'd go ahead and copy ~qtilebackup/.config/qtile~ to my ~.config~ folder

** Extras
*** Scripts
There's a bunch of scripts I wrote and find useful in ~/qtile/scripts/misc/~ folder. Check it out if you like. The dmenu script to launch scripts is ~dm-launch.sh~. I binded it to ~Meta+Slash~ in my qtile config

*** Emacs
I use emacs as my main text editor, thus my config files are heavily skewed towards making emacs integrate with the system. There's also a basic neovim config in here if you want to use that.
