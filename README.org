#+title: My backed up qtile and other config files
#+author: Hp



This is my dotfiles for my whole qtile system, including dots for tools I used.

I wrote about my full experience daily driving qtile [[https://peterconfidential.com/qtile-review-tips-tricks][here]], so check it out if you like to read further

** Why is everything so large?

I'm using a 7 inch umpc, hence the scaling needs to be that way. The plus side is it makes for good demonstration and screenshots. You can scale back the DPI with ~.Xresources~ file and reduce bar size in ~qtile/config.py~.

** Need to know
This repo is really meant to be used just by me, as there are my personal packages and tools included in this repository.

I run the script ~backup.sh~ periodically to copy all my personal dotfiles to this repo and upload it to github.

You're however welcome to check it all out and use what you'd like.

If you want to install everything as is what I have though, run the ~installscript.sh~ file.

*You really should open the file first and read it through though. Comment out or delete the stuff you don't want installed on your own system.*

Ideally, if I were you, I'd look into which tools I'd like to check out, and only copy the dotfiles of that tool. E.g, if I want to check out this repo's qtile config, I'd go ahead and copy ~qtilebackup/.config/qtile~ to my ~.config~ folder

** Extras
There's a bunch of scripts I wrote and find useful in ~/qtile/scripts/misc/~ folder. Check it out if you like. The dmenu script to launch scripts is ~dm-launch.sh~. I binded it to ~Meta+Slash~ in my qtile config

Enjoy!
