This is my dotfiles for my whole qtile system, including dots for tools I used.

It's really meant to be used just by me, as there are my personal packages and tools included in this repository.

I run the script ~backup.sh~ periodically to copy all my personal dotfiles to this repo and upload it to github.

You're however welcome to check it all out and use what you'd like.

If you want to install everything as is what I have though, run the ~installscript.sh~ file.

*You really should open the file first and read it through though. Comment out or delete the stuff you don't want installed on your own system.*

Ideally, if I were you, I'd look into which tools I'd like to check out, and only copy the dotfiles of that tool. E.g, if I want to check out this repo's qtile config, I'd go ahead and copy ~~/qtilebackup/.config/qtile~ to my ~.config~ folder

Enjoy!
